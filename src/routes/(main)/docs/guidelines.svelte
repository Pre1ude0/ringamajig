    <h1>Webring guidelines</h1>
    <nl>
        <li>
            Have an acessible web page (semi accessible on <a
                href="https://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/responsive-design-in-3-steps"
                target="_blank">mobile</a
            > at the very least)
        </li>
        <li>
            Have the required meta tags and iframe in your page (<a
                href="#how-to-join">see below</a
            >)
        </li>
        <li>
            The webring widget should be visible or easily accessible on your
            page (maximum 1 click/scroll away from the top of the page)
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't promote hate speech, racism, sexism, homophobia or any other
            form of discrimination (this should be pretty obvious, but I'm
            adding it anyway)
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't promote the use of generative image AI tools (using AI images
            and artwork on your site falls under this rule)
        </li>
        <li>
            NSFW content is <strong>strictly</strong> prohibited, lewd implications
            are allowed to a degree if not taken too far
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't use the webring to promote your own products or services
            (unless it's a non-profit/open source project and/or not the main
            focus of your site)
        </li>
